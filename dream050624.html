    <center><h2>telltale (5/6/24)</h2></center>
    <h3>
        this dream took place in a telltale video game where every person has 3 lives, and this evil man this evil evil man is trying to put everyone's lives at one for the absolute fairness of whatever whatever.<br><br>
        You go into his temple thing to go fight a bunch of kami-kaze leopard bombers, and have like this hack and slash gameplay to deal with the other enemies.<br><br>
        Then, evil guy surrounds you with normal civilians that are on their last life, these civilians have a troubled and depressed look on their faces, there's a close-up to this one guy crying somewhere in there.<br><br>
        So our protagonist doesn't hit them, and the evil guy says “maybe it isn't your time to die, but it’s not your time to live, yet”, thus kicking off the events of Fallout!!!!!<br><br>
        I don't know why that's what my brain made canon but here we are<br><br>
