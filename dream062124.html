    <center><h2>patrick works at the TSA (6/21/24)</h2></center>
    <h4>
      so in this dream we have patrick star trying to get a job in the krusty krab and he fails, obviously because he's this dumb dumb guy and can't get a job with anything and that kinda sucks so he decides he needs to get a job with this airplane service, and patrick is working as TSA essentially, checking people in, and we have this montage of showing he's doing a great job, properly reviewing their luggage, and making sure they're okay to come in.<br><br>
      At the end of it, the manager comes out and says "You let everyone in???" as if as TSA you are SUPPOSED to turn some people away from their flight. <br><br>
      Patrick is distraught by this, so later on he goes up to the manager and says "you can fire me, or I can go apologize to everyone individually", which doesn't really make sense but the manager goes with the apology route, so Patrick spends a bit of time apologizing to everyone. <br><br>
      We cut to a different scene of me and my brother rummaging through the lost and found in this back corridor of the area, sifting through slips of paper for funsies yknow.<br><br>
      We found several checks for hundreds of dollars but since it felt like rummaging (because it was) we stopped fairly quickly, still commenting on a bunch of the stuff in the lost and found for a bit.<br><br>
      We cut back to Patrick apologizing to everyone, then an alarm blares.<br><br>
      We cut to these lizard aliens who have been planning on breaking into the airport for a while now and today was the best day to do it because the TSA let everyone through and there were minimal defenses. <br><br>
      So, they burst through the wall and started shooting people with space guns.<br><br>
      But, since Patrick apologized to everyone (for some reason) they banded together and fought against the lizard aliens.<br><br>
      All of a sudden, behind the fish folk, another wall breaks, and it's a bunch of robots with human heads in jars on top of them.<br><br>
      If they die, their jar head turns head and they kinda just fall over and die whoops.<br><br>
      Those cyborg people HATE the aliens, and start attacking them.<br><br>
      They win against the aliens and yippee woohoo the fish folk are excited!<br><br>
      But then the cyborgs go against the fish folk, and then the fish folk also somehow win because Patrick Star is the goat or something.<br><br>
      The manager then promotes him to work on TSA on yachts for some reason and that's swell for him
