    <center><h2>monster roleplay based on that four hour video about the star wars hotel (6/4/24)</h2></center>
    <h3>
      had a dream where we were playing the roleplay experience by making a movie about these monsters coming to a town to wreak havoc on the citizens, but it was like a silly pretend thing and you can mark your allegiance on your phone.<br><br>
      This town we were protecting had weird hypnotic undertones that were a bit weird, as apparently “if all the old people are under the spell everyone else will just listen to them”.<br><br>
      That plotline doesn’t really go anywhere but still.<br><br>
      I kept trying to lock the monsters in a room with a door and it was too hard to lock the door so it didn’t lock and then we had a back and forth with the door locking and unlocking until eventually we just gave up this roleplay experience because it was boring and went home.

    </h3>
