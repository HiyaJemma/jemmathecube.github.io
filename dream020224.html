    <center><h2>word salad (2/2/24)</h2></center>
    <h3>
      We're in this festival with all the kids in the world begging for water as we play video games and eat food from concession stands.<br><br>
      Then I wake up at 8, fall back asleep, and have a wild ride. <br><br><br><br>
      We start off our dream with Mickey and the gang trying to punch each other to death for some reason, and that sparks the investigation into “dantdm word salad” and got a few results for this one game where a horse has to escape a building with a sword.<br><br>
      It has an obama skin that has 5 sets of vertical teeth and helps carry a lot of stuff. <br><br>
      Then, we shift over to this metroidvania focused on exploring the brain, collecting fragments and memories to assemble together at a brainsmith to unlock new areas.<br><br>
      The only areas I remember are a blue area you start in, and a red area that seemed harder to traverse, and you collected molecules or something and combined them.<br><br>
      Then, I'm on this really fucking large pole in the sky, forced to play just dance 2024; I somehow escape and barge into a castle by forcing the gate open with a stroller.<br><br>
      Then I woke up and oh god it's 11 am<br><br>
      </h3>
