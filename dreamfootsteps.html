    <center><h2>footsteps (???)</h2></center>
    <h4>
        I wake up from my bed, and look around my room.<br><br>
        Everything seems weirdly far away, yet at the same distance as everything is in my room.<br><br>
        I exit my room, and enter the living room.<br><br>
        This house looks exactly like my house.<br><br>
        It looks real, it feels real, I can even hear my breath and my footsteps.<br><br>
        I notice that the sliding door to go outside looks weirdly far away, and I try to count my footsteps as I go towards it, to see if it is truly that far away.<br><br>
        I take steps towards the desk, turn left, pass the couch on my left, and I'm at the sliding door.<br><br>
        I realize that the amount of footsteps is way too little for the amount of space I felt like I've travelled, so I try to go back to my room, counting my footsteps.<br><br>
        I pass the couch on my right, run into a Christmas tree in the corner of the room, turn right, and enter into the hallway connected to my room. <br><br>
        Schematic: <br><br>
        <img src="images/dreams/IMG_1152.jpeg"><br><br>
        I then return to my bedroom, and get in bed, before having a crisis about the amount of distance a footstep even is.<br><br>
        So, I get back up, and try to recount the amount of footsteps from my room to the door.<br><br>
        I end up realizing that I should be counting in thousands, just to be safe and make sure it is as far away as I think it is.<br><br>
        So, I quickly make it into the millions of footsteps between my room and the door, and I start getting an existential crisis.<br><br>
        How long have I truly been here, counting footsteps?<br><br>
        How much distance am I really going?<br><br>
        I start to panic, running between each destination, not counting footsteps anymore.<br><br>
        The amount of distance stays exactly the same, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm traveling more distance than I actually am.<br><br>
        I keep going, and going, and going, running back and forth, attempting to vaguely get an idea of my own home, counting how long I'm running back and forth.<br><br>
        Hours, days?<br><br>
        I reach a billion footsteps, but I still cannot believe the amount of distance between my room and the door.<br><br>
        It feels alien to me, it's an unbelievable amount of distance.<br><br>
        I continue, back and forth, back and forth, stupendously reaching a billion trillion steps, because each footstep is an atom, and I'm counting by thousands.<br><br>
        Then I realize that the door is infinitely far away, and I'm never able to reach the door ever again.<br><br>
        Then I actually wake up, and I get up to look around, bewildered at that dream. <br><br>
        The actual schematic of my house is as follows: <br><br>
        <img src="images/dreams/IMG_1153.jpeg"><br><br>
        I couldn't fall back asleep for hours.
