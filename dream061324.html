    <center><h2>submarine in a school (6/13/24)</h2></center>
    <h3>
      so this was a dream about recollecting my memories and going back to some earlier grade in my life to experience the same moments I've forgotten about before.<br><br>
      Apparently I was some brat because I screamed at the top of my lungs something about someone being a bitch or something? <br><br>
      I don't entirely remember. <br><br>
      Point being, from that interaction, me from the future is sent to this detention area which is a weird submarine in the basement of the school, where I review my time shenanigans or whatever.<br><br>
      Then a bunch of people pass through this submarine to the other side to go catch one naughty kid.<br><br>
      Strict school huh?<br><br>
      I swear way more stuff happened that I just forgot about
    </h3>
