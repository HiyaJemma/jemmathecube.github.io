    <center><h2>stranger things cruise?? (6/26/24)</h2></center>
    <h3>
      We open up the scene on playing Total Drama for some reason, hanging on these chain pulley things and feeding food to some birds, making sure not to fall off.<br><br>
      Then Chris springs us into the air wildly, and me and Olivia start talking about the future and what she might want to do as a career while flying midair nonchalantly. <br><br>
      I bring up cruise ships as something that would work as a career, then Olivia and I climb into a car midair that just appears then boom we cut to us in a taxi right next to some cruise ships.<br><br>
      I get on one and start showing someone where to put their laundry, so we go downstairs, thinking it's a different cruise ship with different rules, and we end up finding my family chilling in their underwater suite.<br><br>
      Apparently this room is better in September for the Stranger Things show though so we got it cheap in December.<br><br>
      We go up these stairs outside to a little pool area that lets out into the ocean.<br><br>
      Everyone except me swims out and tries to reach a nearby island and come back. <br><br>
      Everyone emerges from underwater at the same time because they were swimming underwater for some reason?<br><br>
      But anyway then my sister vomits up some mac and cheese and I ask her to clean it up. <br><br>
      My mom pops up and asks her to try the floor mac and cheese, before smelling it and realizing it's probably not good for consumption.
